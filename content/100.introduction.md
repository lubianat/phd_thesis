## The Human Cell Atlas 
* Data interoperability challenges
* Data interoperability challenges
* knowledge interoperability challenges

Some of the interoperability challenges fit within the larger quest to extract and integrate literature knowledge. 
Biocuration and literature based discovery. 

## Literature Based Discovery, hidden knowledge and text-mining

* Tsunami of knowledge - o parse,  connect and benefit society
* Literature based discovery is a way to connect knowledge
  * Biocuration and organization
  * Actual processing of the curated information

## Knowledge graphs as tools for interoperability

* The OBO Foundry and biomedical ontologies

* Knowledge graphs and a different approach to biomedical semantics

* Wikidata as a knowledge graph for the life sciences
